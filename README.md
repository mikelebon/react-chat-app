# What is this?

react-chat-app is a super simple ReactJS chat web-app with Firebase backend created to explore the FB realtime database.

# How was it made?

This app was bootstrapped from `create-react-app`. Nothing special here.
It makes use of Redux, Styled Components and the Firebase SDK.

# How do I check it out?

1- Clone the repo<br>
2- Create a Firebase project and grab the web-app configuration details<br>
3- Modify `fb.conf.example.js` as per the included instructions<br>
4- `yarn install` then `yarn start`<br>


# What can I do with it?

Here are some ideas:
- Modify it to make it your own and have fun messing around with it
- Use it as the starting point for the next WhatsApp (jk of course)

__Enjoy!__
